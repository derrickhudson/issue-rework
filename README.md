# issue-rework
Love the *Issue* Tumblr theme! It uses up more screen real-estate than most grid layout themes and has great customization options built-in. Really perfect for minimalist image grids. I found a couple issues that could be improved on:

- [X] support images with height: auto (don't limit to 600px)
- [ ] add page numbers to infinite scrolled pages
